Introduction

The corpus is the reggaeton music of the 2000s and the reggaeton music of today. This corpus was chosen because reggaeton is my favorite music genre, as soon as I hear the music all my nerves start dancing in my body. Also, if you compare how many Spanish songs were in the global top 50 playlist of the 2000s, it is very striking that it is much less than today. In the course of the nineties, the reggaeton genre has become very popular among the young people. In the early 21st century, this genre has also flowed to the United States and a few years later it reached Europe and the rest of the world.

The comparison points are the beats of the music. Reggaeton is usually full of bright and high frequencies (like EDM). I expect that the beats would be the same, the same things were they are going to sing about; crime, sex and love.

One of the old songs that went viral through Europa is Rakata from Wisin and Yandel, made in 2005.
